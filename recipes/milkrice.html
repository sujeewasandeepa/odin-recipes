        <li>3 3/4 cups of water</li>
        <li>400ml of thick coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice and drain the water, and put into a rice cooker
            or a pot that you use to cook rice.
        </li>
        <li>Add water and 1tsp salt and cook the rice</li>
        <li>Add the thick coconut milk adn the rest of the salt to it and
            dissolve well.
        </li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk to the cooked rice as soon as the rice is 
            cooked.
        </li>
        <li>Mix rice and coconut milk very well until the rice grains breakdown
            and everything sticks together. 
        </li>
        <li>Now can transfer the rice to a banana leaf or a tray and shape it.
            But if you still get the row coconut milk smell can cook it again
            for around 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>To shape the rice, transfer it to a cleaned banana leaf (while the
            rice is still hot) then shape the milk rice with another banana leaf
            as you want.
        </li>
        <li>Then you get a knife and put a little of coconut mik or water on it
            so it will not stick to the rice. And cut it into squares or diamond
            shapes.
        </li>
