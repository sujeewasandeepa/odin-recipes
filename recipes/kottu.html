    <h2>The mac burger in Sri Lanka</h2>
    <p>
        Kottu rotti is a very famous(probably the most famous)
        dish in Sri Lanka. It's made with a lot of ingredients 
        like flour, vegetables, eggs and meat. It's normally 
        eaten with a curry. Cheese Kottu is an exception though.
        If you ever go to Sri Lanka, this is a must try plate.
